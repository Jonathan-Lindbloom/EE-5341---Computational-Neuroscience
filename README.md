# EE5341 - Computational-Neuroscience

This respository contains the MATLAB scripts I have written while taking the EE 5341 - Computational Neuroscience course at SMU. We used Paul Miller's An Introductory Course in Computational Neuroscience, and the scripts here are numbered according to the tutorial assignments found in the book.
